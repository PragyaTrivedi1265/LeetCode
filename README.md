ðŸš€ LeetCode Solutions: My Daily DSA Practice
A curated collection of my solutions to problems on LeetCode, implemented primarily in Python / Java. This repository serves as a personal log of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey and a resource for tracking my progress

ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Motivation
Consistency: Solve at least one LeetCode problem daily to build a strong algorithmic foundation.

Mastery: Deepen my understanding of fundamental data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps) and algorithms (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Sorting, Searching).

Portfolio: Document my problem-solving approach and clean code implementation for technical interview preparation.
